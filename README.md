This project is about working and application of Delhi Metro
The Delhi Metro serves as a lifeline for millions of people residing in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). This project was developed using the Python programming language with the goal of providing commuters in Delhi NCR, primarily those traveling on the Delhi Metro, with comprehensive information and analysis for their professional and tourism-related journeys throughout the city. It particularly focuses on connecting residential areas to office regions, which are often located in nearby capital regions like Noida, Gurugram, and even Faridabad.

The main objective of the project is to offer users detailed route information, including any necessary in-station train changes, fares, travel times, and distances. The project relies on various libraries and APIs, with a particular emphasis on Matplotlib for mapping Delhi Metro stations and route information. Additionally, the project utilizes a MySQL database for log storage, with multiple backups in place to handle situations where the program cannot connect to the database or when a specific directory is unavailable.

Within the program, there is a scripted-type chatbot named "METROBOT" that can address frequently asked questions about the Delhi Metro, the project itself, and even off-topic queries. In conclusion, the project has been successfully completed and works to serve users with the required information and route analysis they need for their journeys in Delhi NCR.
