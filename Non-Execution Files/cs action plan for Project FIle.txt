-Introduction to Metro Transit
(What is Metro and others Details)

-Objective of the project DMTC

-Scope of the project
Will be explained via Images

-System Design, Interface and Execution
(GUI, Chatbot,etc.)

-Modules and Libraries Used
following modules were used throught the project
matplotlib
PySimpleGUI
random
...etc

-Following Self Created Modules were used
Modules
GUI
Metrobot.py
FAQ
snake.py
flappybird.py

-Following application programming interface (API) products were used
openweathermap.org
newsapi.org

-Databases and Support Files Used
1) DMTC Stations CS Database.csv File
for Line information about stations and Mapping Coordinates of Stations. Works For Main Functionalities

2) MySQL database
For Log Dumping

3) bin_dmtc_templogs.dat binary file
for log dumping in case of Connectivity issues with MySQL
When Connectivity is Rectified and Established The data is then transfered to MySQL Database and this binary file is removed

4) jokes.txt
Will be Working for chatbot(as discussed Earlier in system design) to display jokes
This file will be working with Module(will be discussed ahead) pyjokes for better Output

5) Remember file.dat
Will be Working for chatbot to remember any statement if asked by dumping the statements

6) notes.txt
Will be Working for chatbot to Make notes if ordered

7)...(inludes png files and wav files and others..)...etc
